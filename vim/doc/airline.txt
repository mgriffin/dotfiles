*airline.txt*  Lean and mean statusline that's light as air

==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION                                                       *airline*

vim-airline is a fast and lightweight alternative to powerline, written
in 100% vimscript with no outside dependencies.

==============================================================================
FEATURES                                                  *airline-features*

*  tiny core written with extensibility in mind.
*  integrates with many popular plugins.
*  looks good with regular fonts, and provides configuration points so you
   can use unicode or powerline symbols.
*  optimized for speed; it loads in 1ms.
*  fully customizable; if you know a little |statusline| syntax you can
   tweak it to your needs.
*  trivial to write colorschemes; for a minimal theme you need to edit
   9 lines of colors. (please send pull requests)

NAME                                                          *airline-name*

Where did the name come from?

I wrote this on an airplane, and since it's light as air it turned out to be a
good name :-)

==============================================================================

COMMANDS                                                  *airline-commands*

:AirlineTheme {theme-name}                                   *:AirlineTheme*

==============================================================================
CUSTOMIZATION                                        *airline-customization*

The following are some unicode symbols for customizing the left/right
separators, as well as the powerline font glyths.

>
  " unicode symbols
  let g:airline_left_sep = '»'
  let g:airline_left_sep = '▶'
  let g:airline_right_sep = '«'
  let g:airline_right_sep = '◀'
  let g:airline_linecolumn_prefix = '␊ '
  let g:airline_linecolumn_prefix = '␤ '
  let g:airline_linecolumn_prefix = '¶ '
  let g:airline_branch_prefix = '⎇ '
  let g:airline_paste_symbol = 'ρ'
  let g:airline_paste_symbol = 'Þ'
  let g:airline_paste_symbol = '∥'

  " powerline symbols
  let g:airline_left_sep = ''
  let g:airline_left_alt_sep = ''
  let g:airline_right_sep = ''
  let g:airline_right_alt_sep = ''
  let g:airline_branch_prefix = ' '
  let g:airline_readonly_symbol = ''
  let g:airline_linecolumn_prefix = ' '

  " old vim-powerline symbols
  let g:airline_left_sep = '⮀'
  let g:airline_left_alt_sep = '⮁'
  let g:airline_right_sep = '⮂'
  let g:airline_right_alt_sep = '⮃'
  let g:airline_branch_prefix = '⭠'
  let g:airline_readonly_symbol = '⭤'
  let g:airline_linecolumn_prefix = '⭡'
<

For more intricate customizations, you can replace the predefined sections
with the usual statusline syntax.

>
  " here are the the default values
  let g:airline_section_a      (the mode/paste indicator)
  let g:airline_section_b      (the fugitive/lawrencium branch indicator)
  let g:airline_section_c      (bufferline or filename)
  let g:airline_section_gutter (syntastic, readonly flag)
  let g:airline_section_x      (tagbar, filetype)
  let g:airline_section_y      (fileencoding, fileformat)
  let g:airline_section_z      (percentage, line number, column number)

  " here is an example of how you could replace the branch indicator with
  " the current working directory, followed by the filename.
  let g:airline_section_b = '%{getcwd()}'
  let g:airline_section_c = '%t'
<

If there is a particular plugin or filetype that is not supported, you can
extend it by adding a function reference to the global array.  Here is an
example that you could add to your vimrc:
>
  function! MyPlugin()
    if &filetype == 'MyPluginFileType'
      let w:airline_section_a = 'MyPlugin'
      let w:airline_section_b = '%f'
      let w:airline_section_c = '%{MyPlugin#function()}'
    endif
  endfunction
  call add(g:airline_window_override_funcrefs, function('MyPlugin'))
<

In a similar fashion, you can define a function to exclude a window from
having its statusline modified.
>
  function! ExcludeFoo()
    return &filetype == 'FooType'
  endfunction
  call add(g:airline_exclude_funcrefs, function('ExcludeFoo'))
<

==============================================================================
WRITING THEMES                                              *airline-themes*

Themes are written "close to the metal" -- you will need to know some basic
VimL syntax to write a theme, but if you're written in any programming
language it will be easy to pick up.  Have a look at the dark.vim theme
where it is fully documented.
