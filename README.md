# My Dotfiles

This is a repository of my config files so that I can set things up as I like
them to be. 

## Installation

Just run the following commands from the command line

```terminal
git clone git@github.com:mgriffin/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
rake install
```

``plain_zshrc`` is used by boxen to install a config file for zsh that doesn't
use ``oh-my-zsh``. I am going to move away from ``oh-my-zsh`` in the near future
and this is the start of it.
